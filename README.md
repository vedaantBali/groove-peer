# Groove-Peer

## Peer for [Groove-Chain](https://github.com/vedaantBali/groove-chain#readme)
---
The peers are used to setup servers for the users on heroku. Each peer may have their own server which keeps their wallet active.

---

The users may clone this repository and push it to their heroku server. After this, they may use the [Groove-Wallet](https://snapcraft.io/groove-wallet) to send Groove-Coins to other peers. 

In the current release, you may mine only from the Terminal Application or using Postman, as explained in [Groove-Chain](https://github.com/vedaantBali/groove-chain#readme).

The URL to use in the app will be same as the name of the heroku app you have created, example ***groove-chain***.herokuapp.com
